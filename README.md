# Talk is cheap; prove it by doing it.

>I’m too old to worry about who likes me and who dislikes me.    
>I have more important things to do.    
>If you love me ,I love you too.    
>If you support me, I support you too.    
>If you hate me, I don’t care.    
>Life goes on with or without you.

Some people say that "Talk is cheap, show me the code" is outdated, because we’re in the era of "social" programming, where talk is mainstream, and there’s no need to show code.     
They like to brag and then tell their "subordinates" to make it happen. 
Or, this is the motivation to be a "boss"      

In the past, engineers wrote a lot of code, then compiled their knowledge into books, benefiting other engineers.     
Now, social-media-type engineers mainly surf the web, with skills limited to "Hello World," installations, and running demos.       
They're either clickbait writers or share short reposts from others and focus on playing the role of an expert on social media and company.      
Pah!
