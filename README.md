# Talk is cheap; prove it by doing it.


Some people say that "Talk is cheap, show me the code" is outdated; now we’re in the era of social programming, where talk is mainstream, and there’s no need to show code.    
In the past, engineers wrote a lot of code, then compiled their knowledge into books, benefiting other engineers. Now, social-media-type engineers mainly surf the web, with skills limited to "Hello World," installations, and running demos. They're either clickbait writers or share short reposts from others and focus on playing the role of an expert on social media. Pah!
